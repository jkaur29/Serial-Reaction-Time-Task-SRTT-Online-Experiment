# Serial-Reaction-Time-Task-SRTT-Online-Experiment
This the first project I completed as a PhD student. Due to COVID-19, the data for this project was acquired entirely online and it allowed us to study the effect of learning using the standard Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) in an online environment.

Project aims: testing the effect of task instructions in an SRTT paradigm by randomly assigning participants to the explicit or implicit learning conditions, while making use of both the auditory and visual stimuli;and to determine whether the SRTT paradigm can be employed online to study sequence learning.

There are 4 different R analysis files here:
File 1: 1_implicitdataonly_accuracy.Rmd: is used for analyzing only the implicit learning data's accuracy for this project
File 2: 2_explicitdataonly_accuracy.Rmd: is used for analyzing only the explicit learning data's accuracy for this project
File 3: 3_implicitdataonly.Rmd: is used for analyzing the reaction time data associated with the implicit learning condition
File 4: 4_explicitdataonly.Rmd: is used for analyzing the reaction time data associated with the implicit learning condition
File 5: Acc.Data.Viz.Rmd: Data visualization code to plot out accuracy across the different learning conditions
File 6: Implicit+Explicit Data Visualization: Data Visualization code to plot out the accuracy across the different learning condtiions
